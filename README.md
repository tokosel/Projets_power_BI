# Power-BI-Solution-for-Telecom-Company

This project is completed during the PwC Digital Accelerator Program, aimed to provide a Power BI solution to a Telecom Company. The project had three key deliverables:

 1) Call Center Data Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and analyze call center data.
 2) Telecom Customer Churn Analysis: A BI solution was developed to understand and predict customer churn.
 3) Diversity and Inclusion Analysis: An analysis was conducted to understand diversity and inclusion within the organization.

### 1. Analysis of Call Centre’s Data : 

Report covers an analysis of call data from call center. The aim was to track the
process and performance of agents. 

#### Overview of Call Data :

  #### Total no of calls received : 5000
  #### Call Topics with count of call received:
* Technical Support: 1019
* Streaming: 1022
* Payment related: 1007
* Contract related: 976
* Admin Support: 976
  

#### Key Findings

* Out of the total calls received, 4054 were answered, with a total of 3646 calls
resolved.
* The average call satisfaction rating was 3.4/5, which is below the
ideal/recommended call satisfaction rate of 4.5.
* The average speed of answer by an agent was 54.75 seconds.
* There were several unanswered calls across different topics, with Technical
Support contributing the most with 214 unanswered calls.

#### Detailed Breakdown by Topic : 
| Topic | # Calls Unanswered | # Calls Resolved | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| Technical Support | 214 | 736 |
| Streaming | 175 | 749 | 
| Payment related | 189 |  729 | 
| Contract related | 187 | 729 | 
| Admin Support | 181 | 723 |  

#### Call Resolution Details 

The call resolution rate by agents varied from 88% to 91%, which is below the ideal/recommended benchmark of call resolution rate of 95%.

#### Implications and Recommendations

Given these findings, there are several areas where performance can be improved:

1. Improve Call Satisfaction: With an average rating of 3.4/5, there is room for improvement in customer satisfaction. Training programs focusing on customer handling and problem-solving can be beneficial.
2. Reduce Unanswered Calls: The number of unanswered calls, especially in Technical Support, is a concern. Allocating more resources or improving efficiency in these areas could help reduce the number of unanswered calls.
3. Increase Call Resolution Rate: The call resolution rate is below the ideal benchmark. Strategies to improve this could include additional training for agents or reviewing the current processes for potential inefficiencies.

### 2. Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 

#### What is Customer Churn?

Customer Churn refers to the natural business cycle of losing and acquiring customers. Every company — no matter the quality of its products or customer service experiences churn. In the context of businesses, customer churn can occur due to factors such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offerings, or changes in circumstances or preferences of the customer. Generally speaking, the less churn a company has, the more customers they keep.

#####  The report provided a clear and interactive way to communicate my findings, helping the client to better understand their customer behavior and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.


#### Key Insights :

##### From Customer Base : 

* There is almost equal number of male - female in customer base.
* In total Customer base 53.45% of customer are using services from less then 1 year.  
* From customer account it is found that 55% of customer are on month to month contract type and 24% are two year contract and 20% are on 1 year contract, using service.
* 75% of Customer prefer Paperless billing.
* Most perefered payment method is electronic check, 35.6% of total used same method.

#### From Risk Analysis : 

* Overall Churn Rate is 26.54 % . Total customer churned is 1869
* Senior-Citizens are more likely to churn, 25% of senior-citizen subscribers churned.
* Form internet service subscribers 41% of customers churned were from fibre optics user.
* customers with month-month contract are most likely to churn,churn rate of 42%.
* Higher the year of contract the lower is churn rate.
* Only 2.8% of churn rate in customers having 2 years of contract.  

### Recommendations

* Encourage customers to opt for longer contract durations, such as one or two-year contracts, as these customers are less likely to churn.
* Provide incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to longer-term contracts.
* Provide senior citizens with tailored offers and services that address their unique needs and concerns to reduce churn rates.
* Focus on retaining female customers with month-to-month contracts, as they appear to be more likely to churn than male customers with the same contract type.
* Offer convenient payment options and automate payment processes to reduce the number of customers who churn due to manual payment mode.
* Address the reasons behind the churn of customers with fiber optic internet to reduce the high churn rate among this customer segment.

### 3. Diversity and Inclusion Analysis : 

   In this report HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis is done, I designed a Power BI dashboard report and formulated measures to define relevant KPIs to track and evaluate the organization's diversity initiatives. I analyzed various demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, nationality and utilized the data to calculate critical metrics to gain valuable insights into the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts.
   This project served as a valuable tool for HR managers to evaluate and measure the organization's progress towards creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace culture. Through this project, I was able to provide actionable insights and data-driven decisions to ensure the organization's continuous growth towards diversity and inclusion goals.

#### Key Insights and Recommandations  

* There is a lack of diversity in the senior management where all senior and executive management are predominantly male, indicating there may be bias in recruitment and gender inequality in promotion.

* Most women employees are in junior positions so, the organizations can conduct a review of recruitment and hiring practices and provide access to training and development opportunities to help women develop the skills necessary to advance into higher-level positions. This could include mentorship and sponsorship programs, leadership development programs, and cross-functional training.

* The fact that the average performance ratings for FY20 for female and male employees are very similar (2.42 for females and 2.41 for males) suggests that there may be gender equality in terms of performance within the company. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the company is evaluating employees based on their actual performance, rather than any bias or stereotypes based on gender. However, there may be room for improvement in terms of employee performance, and it is important to be vigilant for potential biases that could impact the evaluation process.
